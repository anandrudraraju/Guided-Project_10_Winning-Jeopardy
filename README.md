Winning Jeopardy

## Introduction

Jeopardy is a popular TV show in the US where participants answer questions to win money. It's been running for a few decades, and is a major force in popular culture.

In this project, we'll work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions to figure out some patterns in the questions that could help you win.

The dataset is named jeopardy.csv, and contains 20000 rows from the beginning of a full dataset of Jeopardy questions, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file).

Each row in the dataset represents a single question on a single episode of Jeopardy. Here are explanations of each column:

- Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.
- Air Date -- the date the episode aired.
- Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.
- Category -- the category of the question.
- Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.
- Question -- the text of the question.
- Answer -- the text of the answer.
